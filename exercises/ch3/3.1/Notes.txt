This implements the use of a function to combine isNaN and isInf.

https://github.com/torbiak/gopl/blob/master/ex3.1/main.go
Implements isNaN directly in the main function and strings together for all the variables.
This doesn't account for infinite values.
This does run the checks after computing all of the values.

https://github.com/Julineo/golang1training/blob/master/3/3.1/main.go
Implements both isNaN and isInf.
Checks for the variables are immediately after executing the corner func.

Program execution:
go run main.go >> surface.svg
* Saves to a html file that can be opened via a web browser.

Additional optimization/improvements can be achieved via things, such as refactoring the main function to handle i/o, 
while the image generation is done via a separate surface function.
